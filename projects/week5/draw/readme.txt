My project is based on simple line drawing. When you draw a line, 2 kinds of items will automatically grow alongside it. I also apply parameterization and noise to the system. You can control the size and proportion of the items and the average interval of 2 items. There is also randomness in many places, including the interval and type of item generated. You can adjust the noise by modifying the noise parameter.
