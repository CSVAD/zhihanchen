I try to create a simple chair design system. I represent a chair by 3 parts: back, seat and legs and add constrains and degrees of freedom among them. There are 3 geometric constrains to make it a stable chair: the legs should be on the corner of the seat; the back should be at the side of the seat; the length of the back should be the same as the length of the seat. There are 8 degrees of freedom for the chair: 3 on colors of the chair; 2 on the width and height of the back; 2 on the width and height of the legs; 1 on the width of the seat. 
Many different kinds of chairs can be created by this program, such as long chairs (sample1), commcon chairs (sample2) and chairs without back (sample3), etc.
