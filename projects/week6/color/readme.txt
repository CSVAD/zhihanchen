In my color picker, the color can be controlled in 2 ways, directly modifying h,s,b value or controlling with mouse move and mousewheel(with keyboard c pressed). User can paint the current color out using the mouse. In order to make controlling easier, I add a speed parameter for the second method. I also maintain a circle displaying the current color in the up-middle of the screen to let user see the way that color changes. The interface is convinient for creating gradient colors by dragging the mouse with the 'c' holded. I also added noise parameter to increase the variety of colors when drawing(the current color is not changed, though).
