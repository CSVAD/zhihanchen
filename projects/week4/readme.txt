I try to show the effect of meteoric shower. The parameters are number of stars, the radius of the stars and the average velocity and travel distance of the stars. Randomness exists in many places. The position that the star appears is random, and the velocity and travel distance of each star is sampled from gaussain distribution (with minimum value = 0.15*average). The randomness brings diversity and sense of depth. With the change of parameters, the visual effect also varies a lot.
