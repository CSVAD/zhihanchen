I try to make a wallpaper containing flowers. My flower is constructed by a eye and 4 leaves. For each leaf, I use a triangle and an half-circle to construct it.To add variation on the repetition, I use 2 different colors for eye and leaves and repete them in turn. By showing 3 different scales: 8x8, 16x16 and 64x64, I find that scale really affects the appearance a lot. The 16x16 one looks best for me since in the 8x8 one the flower is too large and 64x64 is too small.
